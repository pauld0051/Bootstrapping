Welcome to the Bootstrap Walkthrough Webpage. The idea of this site is to test Bootstrap features before initialising them. 

grids.html is a file, not for loading on normal sites, that illustrates the 12 column rules set up by Bootstrap. It is designed to allow the user to open the page in a separate location to play around with screensizes to help attain the required column widths for responsive websites. 

16 June 2020: Began new Framework and introduced the Bootstrap CDN to the link. 

17 June 2020: Added JS from Bootstrap. Collected the command lines from <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/download/">Bootstrap CDNs</a>
The Java Script used on this page is tested and safe - it is strongly recommended to use this source and to copy and paste code from this page for other projects. 

Have added a modal and form section as well as a collapsable navigation bar. 

Notes: You should use the CI template for all your milestones, and you do not need to credit it in your readme. All the template does is install everything you need into the workspace that is needed to follow the video lessons. Because originally these were written in a different IDE with different things pre-installed into it. The CI template doesn't write any of your project for you.
